# Productivity tools for Linux/Darwin

Files here are general-purpose Linux/Darwin productivity tools accumulated from my time in the software vocation/avocation.  They are released under the terms of
the BSD two-clause license (see LICENSE.txt).

# Subdirectories

* `fundam` -- Filters I use each and every day in my work as a software
  developer.  Many of them are intended to be used as editor filters, e.g. one
  may left-align a paragraph of text columns by using `!}left` in `vim`.  Another
  primary use is for logsnarfing: who knows what will be in a particular set of
  log file, but powerful things can be done with a set of general-purpose
  text-manipulation tools (including `grep`/`sed`/etc.).

* `abbrevs` -- Essentially aliases, but available from contexts in which
aliases are not evaluable.

* `arith` -- Simple pipe-oriented tools for things like sums and GCDs.

* `one-offs` -- as the name implies

# Language mix

Python, Perl, Bash, Ruby, Go.
There are a few C items at https://github.com/johnkerl/ctools

Language choice is more a function of time than topic: I used C and Perl from
the early/mid-1990's onward; many of the math/stats tools I wrote while in
grad school 2005-2010 are in Python; most of my scripting since then is in
Ruby.
