These are some little utility scripts for manipulating CSV files.

Formats are CSV, horizontal, and vertical.  Examples:

CSV:
```
a,b,c
1,2,3
4,5,6
```

Horizontal:
```
a b c
- - -
1 2 3
4 5 6
```

Vertical:
```
a 1 4
b 2 5
c 3 6
```

CSV is best for storage and piping to various programs -- i.e. for
machine-readability.  I prefer horizontal format for viewing not-to-wide
tables.  I prefer vertical format for viewing the top few columns of very wide
tables.

Converters are `c2h`, `c2v`, `h2c`, `h2v`, `v2c`, `v2h`.  Depending on the data (e.g. data containing whitespace or commas) they are not always invertible transformations.
