Files here are general-purpose Linux productivity tools accumulated from my
time in the software vocation/avocation.  They are released under the terms of
the BSD two-clause license (see LICENSE.txt).

The fundam directory contains filters I use each and every day in my work as a
software developer.  Many of them are intended to be used as editor filters,
e.g. one may left-align a paragraph of text columns by using !}left in vim.
