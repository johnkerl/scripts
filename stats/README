# This is a Python library for some simple statistics routines.
#
# Sometimes, I prefer to have a small, simple set of routines which I wrote and
# completely understand, which do no more and no less than what I want them to
# do.  For black-box statistics software (with far more features), you're
# better off with R, etc.  The code here is of a different sort: simple and
# simple-minded, and intended to be not just used but also read.
