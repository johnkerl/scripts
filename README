================================================================
Files here are general-purpose Linux productivity tools accumulated from my
time in the software vocation/avocation.  They are released under the terms of
the BSD two-clause license (see LICENSE.txt).

Subdirectories:

* arith -- Simple pipe-oriented tools for things like sums and GCDs.

* fundam -- Filters I use each and every day in my work as a software
  developer.  Many of them are intended to be used as editor filters, e.g. one
  may left-align a paragraph of text columns by using !}left in vim.  Another
  primary use is for logsnarfing: who knows what will be in a particular set of
  log file, but powerful things can be done with a set of general-purpose
  text-manipulation tools (including grep/sed/etc.).

* img -- image (e.g. PNG) dimensioning and resizing.

* latex -- tools for LaTeX

* ntbl -- tools for manipulating CSV files

* one-offs -- as the name implies

* perllib -- rather dated (I haven't written much new Perl in years).
  PMATLIB.pm is for vectors and matrices.  line_term_lib.pm is for
  mixing Unix/Windows style files over Samba: it preserves line endings
  based on the file contents, not on the OS doing the I/O.

* pgr -- A plotter wrapped around matplotlib.  I used this for all the
  presentation graphics in my doctoral dissertation.

* pythonlib -- Miscellaneous mathematical routines, except stats.

* rand -- Simple random-number-generator tools.

* stats -- Miscellaneous basic statistical routines and wrapper scripts for
  use on Unix pipes:  mean, standard deviation, covariance and correlation, and
  histograms.

Language mix: Python, Perl, Bash, Ruby.
There are a few C items at https://github.com/johnkerl/ctools
